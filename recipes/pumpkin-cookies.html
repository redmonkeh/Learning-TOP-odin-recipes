    <h2>The OG of the most amazing cookies of the squash persuasion</h2>
    <p>This is one of the first cookies I ever experienced that was not the all to often used basic chocolate chip cookie or sugar cookies. 
        I never knew cookies could be this amazing before this one. I personally do not care for things in my cookies so this version does not have 
        any chocolate chips like a lot of people like to add. Blaphemers.

    <p>  
        They are by no means a pretty cookie, often times the remind me of a pile of poo, 
        but they are delicious and sooooo easy to make that it really doesn't matter. After all they aren't going to last long enough for any pictures anyway.

        The one above is a rare exception and was only accomplished with a large guard detail.
